Peer4commit FAQ
===============

What is Peer4Commit?
--------------------
With Peer4Commit you can add projects from GitHub and donate Peercoins to the ones that interest you the most. Anyone that submits code changes and has them accepted will receive Peercoin tips. This helps in providing an incentive for developers to work on important projects that will benefit Peercoin in the future. Peer4commit was adapted by Sigmike from Tip4commit.

What is a Commit?
-----------------
Each time someone adds changes to the source code of a supported project, he receives 1% of the project balance. A set of changes is called a "commit". Here is an example commit for Peercoin v0.4: https://github.com/ppcoin/ppcoin/commit/5941effd0085dd26ce9b793ec09dcaffae8e5678
